                            Cordova or
                            Las Cordobas in Argentina, Colombia, USA and Mexico, all of them founded and named by
                            Spanish, in
                            memory of the Spanish Cordoba or the surname/family name of its founders.
                            Cordova became a municipality in 1864, and from 1913 up to the present, a total of 15 mayors
                            governed the district.

                                    Then later I found out that Roro is a Famous Food Court or Restaurant in Cordova
                                    that is located in Roro Port Road.
